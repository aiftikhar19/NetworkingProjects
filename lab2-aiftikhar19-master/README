Description:
This lab implements a file-transfer protocol that includes a client and a server. Specifically, ftpc.c functions as a client. 

The client-side file can be run once the server side script has been launched by using the command:

	ftpc <remote IP> <remote port number> <local file to transfer>

<remote IP> is the IP address or host name of the remote server (where the server script was run)
<remote port number> is the port number from the server side script 
<local file to transfer> is the name of a file located on the local client server that is to be transferred

Requirements:
1. In order for the program to run, there must already be a server running. 
2. Possible returned error codes:
	0		OK
	100		Too many bytes received
	300		Error creating the file
	400		Generic server error
	500		Malformed message

Commands:
To compile the program to run, use the command:
	make
To remove the executable and re-compile, use the commands:
	make clean
	make
To run the client side program, identify the IP address and port number the server program is running on, and then use the following command:
	ftpc <remote IP> <remote port number> <local file to transfer>
