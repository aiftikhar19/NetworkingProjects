Description:
This project implements a client side UDP protocol for a version of tic-tac-toe played on different machines. 

The client-side file can be run once the server side script has been launched by using the command:

	tictactoeClient <remote port number> <remote IP> 

<remote port number> is the port number from the server side script 
<remote IP> is the IP address or host name of the remote server (where the server script was run)

Requirements:
1. In order for the program to run, there must already be a server running. 
2. Message format:
	1 byte 		1 byte		 1 byte		1 byte		1 byte
	Unsigned int	Unsigned int	 Unsigned int	Unsigned int	Unsigned int
	Version Number	Connection Code Response Code	Player Move	Turn Number(Starts at 0)
3. Response Codes (Version 1):
	0	No errors
	1	Invalid Move: the requested move cannot be performed given the current board configuration
	2	Game Out of Sync: the turn number is invalid (out of sync)
	3	Invalid Request
	4	Game Over: sent along with game ending move
	5	Game Over Acknowledged: sent as acknowledgement of game over
	6	Incompatible Version Number: the version number is incompatible with local version

Commands:
To compile the program to run, use the command:
	make
To remove the executable and re-compile, use the commands:
	make clean
	make
To run the client side program, identify the IP address and port number the server program is running on, and then use the following command:
	tictactoeClient <remote port number> <remote IP>
